    <string name="hobbiesText">Hobby is that activity to which we dedicate ourselves for pure pleasure.
It occupies our free time, in order to distract our thoughts from everyday obligations.
It exercises skills that we cherish â€” but that we dont have the opportunity to develop in the professional context or in the usual social roles.
We could also describe hobbies as personal challenges.
Things we choose to do with the sole purpose of promoting self-development and self-discovery.
Therefore, a hobby is, at the same time, relaxing and stimulating.
More than hobbies, hobbies are healthy competitions that we have with our own selves, in search of breaking limits (physical, intellectual or creative) and constantly overcoming them.
Talking about hobbies is important because hobbies reflect the lifestyle we want to build.

My hobby has always been playing the guitar, spending time with my friends and family, people I love in general, playing video games, watching movies, spending time reading about random things, riding motorcycles, biking, cooking, traveling and doing cleanings too.</string>
