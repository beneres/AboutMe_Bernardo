    <string name="achievementsInfo">Dreaming is one of the most basic and fundamental principles of the essence of the human being, it is a condition, it is an imposition.

Dreaming is life and conquering a dream is like conquering a piece of life; it is achievement and it is triumph!

But none of this will be possible without us fighting for it, without persistence, without being faithful to our dreams and never giving up on them!</string>
